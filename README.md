# Short-term UV-Index Forecasting unsing LSTMs
## Master thesis
In this work, a neural network is trained to perform short-term prediction of UV-radiation (UV-Index).

Can future UV-index be predicted using current and past data?

The prediction is based on the current irradiance and current meteorological parameters.
One machine learning model suited to this problem is LSTMs (long short-term memory), a type of RNN (recurrent neural network). LSTMs used to predict future sequences in a time series based on past time steps.

Metric used for predictions was the UV-index. This index indicates the erythema weighted UV-radiation and is a tool to inform the public about the intensity of UV-radiation.
