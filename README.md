# Short-term UV-Index Forecasting unsing LSTMs
## Masterarbeit
In this work, a neural network is trained to perform short-term prediction of UV-radiation (UV-Index). For this purpose, a recurrent neural network is trained to predict the UV-index for the next hour.
The prediction is based on the current irradiance and current meteorological parameters.
